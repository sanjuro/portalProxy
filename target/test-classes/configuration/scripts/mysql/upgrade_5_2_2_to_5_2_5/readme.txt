The database migration from 5.2.2 to 5.2.5 involves running the following steps in the order mentioned:

1. Create a backup of the database.

Run these steps before the new Portal Web Application has been deployed!
2. Run pre-dml-upgrade-5.2.2-to-5.2.5.ddl
3. Run upgrade-5.2.2-to-5.2.5.dml

If steps 2 or 3 fail contact Backbase Support.
If you need to rollback the migration install the database backup.
