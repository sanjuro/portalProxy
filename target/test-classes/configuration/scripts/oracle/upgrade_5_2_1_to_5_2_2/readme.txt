The database migration from 5.2.1 to 5.2.2 involves running the following steps in the order mentioned:

1. Create a backup of the database.

Run these steps before the new Portal Web Application has been deployed!
2. Run upgrade-5.2.1-to-5.2.2.dml

If step 2 fails contact Backbase Support.
If you need to rollback the migration install the database backup.
